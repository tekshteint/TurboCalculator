# TurboCalculator
A program made for helping calculate turbo sizing and to help with reading compressor maps


This program will:

 - Estimate crank horsepower
  
 - Calculate pressure ratio given boost target and vice versa
  
 - Convert common airflows used on compressor maps

 - Graph estimated horsepower vs airflow to help gauge efficiency throughout the RPM range
 	- Note this assumes you are always in full boost as calculating spool is not really a possibility so use it with that knowledge in hand.

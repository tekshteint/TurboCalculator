A program made for helping calculate turbo sizing and to help with reading compressor maps


This program will:

	Estimate crank horsepower
  
	Calculate pressure ratio given boost target and vice versa
  
	Convert common airflows used on compressor maps
  
Looking to add:
  
	Images/general improvement of GUI
  
	Formula to estimate boost curves
  
		This will allow estimated dyno graphs
